                      What is Miss To Mrs Bridal Subscription Box?
                    </button>
                    <p class="faq__block-text">
                      Miss To Mrs Bridal Box Subscription is a service that
                      delivers themed boxes of trendiest bridal goodies &
                      planning help throughout your wedding planning journey!
                      Each Miss To Mrs Bridal Box has a different theme that was
                      created to make a specific stage of wedding planning more
                      exciting! Our team created uniquely themed boxes, filled
                      with products you can use before your wedding day, on your
                      wedding day and many even AFTER!
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Your plan will be customized to your wedding date.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      For example, if your wedding is 10 months away, you will
                      get boxes monthly. However, if your wedding is 12+ months
                      away we have options for every 2 months and every 3 months
                      deliveries.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Your plan might also accelerate as you get closer to your
                      date to ensure you get all the themes. So if you started
                      with every 3 months, the plan will accelerate to every 2
                      months and then monthly closer to your date.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      If you found us late and your wedding is less than 10
                      months away, your plan will adjust to either monthly, or
                      we have options for accelerated bi-weekly deliveries.
                      <br />
                      <br />

                      Only a few months to go, and everything is planned, is it

                    </button>
                    <p class="faq__block-text">
                      Yes, even if the wedding is just months away and
                      everything is planned, there's still great value in
                      subscribing to Miss To Mrs. We customize each subscription
                      to cater to specific needs and wedding timelines, ensuring
                      that the bride receives the most relevant box themes that
                      align with her wedding planning journey. Besides, we offer
                      accelerated delivery options such as bi-weekly shipments.
                      If you're interested in even more frequent deliveries, you
                      can always contact us at support@misstomrsbox.com and

                      Our mission is to delight all brides-to-be and help them
                      plan their dream weddings. While over 100,000 brides loved
                      our boxes, we do understand that our box isn't for
                      everyone. That's why all new subscribers after June 1,
                      2021, can cancel their Miss To Mrs Box subscriptions at
                      any time, without any penalties or cancellation fees (as
                      long as you let us know at least 48hrs before the next
                      payment).
